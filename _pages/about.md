# About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the **Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology**, **School of Intelligence**, **Peking University**, supervised by **Prof. Jiahuan Zhou**. I received my B.Eng. in Software Engineering from the **College of Computer Science and Technology**, **Zhejiang University**, in 2025.

My research interests lie in 3D vision and graphics, with a focus on point cloud processing, scene understanding, and neural scene generation. I am particularly interested in developing efficient, geometry-aware models that unify perception and generation within a single framework. Ultimately, my goal is to build powerful real-world 3D perception models that seamlessly integrate understanding and generation capabilities, and can be deployed on humanoid robot platforms for intelligent interaction in complex environments.

Previously, I was a research intern at the **State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG**, Zhejiang University, where I worked with **Prof. Zhaopeng Cui** on large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. These experiences have strengthened my passion for advancing both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of 3D visual understanding and generation.

  **UPP: Unified Point-Level Prompting for Robust Point Cloud Analysis**

  ***ICCV 2025***

  **Zixiang Ai**, Zhenyu Cui, Yuxin Peng, Jiahuan Zhouâ€ 

  <!-- [**Paper**]() &nbsp;  -->
 [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18997) &nbsp; [**Code**](https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP) &nbsp;

- We propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust analysis in a parameter-efficient manner.

  **Vision Graph Prompting via Semantic Low-Rank Decomposition**

  ***ICML 2025***

  **Zixiang Ai**, Zichen Liu, Jiahuan Zhouâ€ 

  [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04121) &nbsp; [**Code**](https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICML2025-VGP) &nbsp;

- In this paper, we propose Vision Graph Prompting (VGP), a novel framework tailored for vision graph structures. Our core insight reveals that semantically connected components in the graph exhibit low-rank properties.
