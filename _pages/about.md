# About Me
I am currently a final undergraduate student at the College of Computer Science, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). I will be commencing my doctoral studies at the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), Peking University in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. Jiahuan Zhou.

My research interest lies in the areas of 3D vision. I had a wonderful time as an on-site research intern at the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, working closely with Prof. Zhaopeng Cui.
